I find that when I try to think up of a logic for a chunk of code. I start off fine but then as it becomes more complicated I get stuck.

WHat I need to try to do is to try to write out the code by hand then resist the urge to code it out on vscode

User Story
As a user I want to be able to input a task item and have it show up as a list format underneath the add task bar

As a user I want the ability to cross off a task item when it is completed.

As a user I want the ability to delete a task item if it is no longer needed.

As a user I want the task items to be there even after refreshing the page.
